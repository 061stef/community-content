We're looking for writers who'd like to talk about their experience using Strapi, JAMstack or open source related things. Although we're mostly looking for experienced authors who have already published blog posts on websites such as [Medium](https://medium.com), [Dev.to](http://dev.to/), [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com), [Scotch.io](http://scotch.io/) or your personal blog, we're also supportive of people who have never published anything but interesting in a writing their first technical piece.

You will definitely pick our interest if you can write articles that go quite in-depth and include a significant number of learning nuggets. We're absolutely NOT looking for promotional pieces or marketing pitches. It's all about interesting thins to tell to the community concerning everything that operate in the Strapi environment.

## Showcase

Show to the community what your project looks like

The entire Strapi team is very curious to see what you guy's can build using our product and it may be the same for people in the community who want to reassure themselves about what we can create with Strapi.

We decided to create a [Showcase](https://github.com/strapi/community-content/tree/master/showcase) section where anyone can list his site that has been made with love, and Strapi off course! This list will be displayed on our website soon.
